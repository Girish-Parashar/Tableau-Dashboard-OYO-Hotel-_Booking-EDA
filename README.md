# 🎉 **OYO Hotel Booking Analysis - Tableau Dashboard & EDA** 🏨

Welcome to the **OYO Hotel Booking Analysis** project, where I've conducted a thorough **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and built an interactive **Tableau Dashboard** to uncover booking trends and insights for two hotels. This data spans from **2015 to 2019**, showcasing key insights such as cancellations, booking patterns, and market segmentation.

## 🎯 **Project Highlights**

### 🚀 **1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
Before diving into the visualizations, I performed a comprehensive **EDA** to clean, preprocess, and analyze the dataset. This foundational analysis allowed us to uncover critical trends, patterns, and insights that guided the dashboard design.
